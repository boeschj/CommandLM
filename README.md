## Usage

### Get Command Suggestions

#### DISCLAIMER: ShellGPT generates shell commands using AI and may be inaccurate. **ALWAYS review and understand any command before executing it** and never blindly run suggested commands. You are responsible for any commands you execute.
 
```bash
# Ask how to perform a task
shellgpt "scaffold a new react application called MyCoolApp using typescript and vite"

# Get help with complex commands
shellgpt "create a tar archive and compress it"

# Understand what a command does
shellgpt "what does chmod 755 do"
```
